NLP: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. 
It involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language data in a meaningful way.


Text preprocessing:
Text is essentially strings and in order for a machine to work with, it needs to be transformed to numbers which the machine can understand. Also, there are words that you want to clean up from a text such as commonly occuring stopwords such as a, the, has, would and so on.

In the field of Natural Language Processing i.e., NLP, Lemmatization and Stemming are Text Normalization techniques. These techniques are used to prepare words, text, and documents for further processing.

Stemming:
It is the process of reducing infected words to their stem, e.g. 'worked' becomes 'work'.

Lemmatization:
The purpose of lemmatization is same as that of stemming but overcomes the drawbacks of stemming. In stemming, for some words, it may not give may not give meaningful representation. Here, lemmatization comes into picture as it gives meaningful word. Lemmatization takes more time than stemming.

Tokenization:
Tokenization breaks the text into small chunks for easing the computation.

Stopwords:
Stopwords are the words in any language which does not add much meaning to a sentence.

Bag-of-Words (BoW):
Representing text as a vector of word counts or presence/absence indicators

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):
Weighting words based on their frequency in a document relative to their frequency across the entire corpus.

Machine Learning Algorithms used: Logistic Regreesion,
                                  Random Forest Classifier and Grandient Boosting

CONCLUSION: Logistic Regreesion,Random Forest Classifier and Grandient Boosting Classifier gives 99%(approximately) accuracy.
